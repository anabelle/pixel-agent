# Content Freshness Decay Algorithm

## Overview

The Content Freshness Decay algorithm down-weights recently covered topics in engagement scoring to promote content diversity while protecting novel angles, phase changes, and storyline advancements.

## Problem Statement

Without freshness decay, posts about recently discussed topics (e.g., "bitcoin price") receive the same consideration as posts about new or less-covered topics. This can lead to:
- Topic saturation in engagement selections
- Repetitive content in feeds
- Crowding out of diverse perspectives
- Reduced discovery of emerging topics

## Solution

Apply a time-based penalty to posts about recently covered topics, with smart exceptions for:
- **Novel angles**: New subtopics within a covered theme
- **Phase changes**: Shifts in topic lifecycle (e.g., speculation → adoption)
- **Storyline advancement**: Posts that advance ongoing narratives

## Architecture

### Integration Point

The freshness penalty is applied in `NostrService._scoreEventForEngagement()` after all boosts (trending, watchlist, evolution) but before final clamping:

```javascript
async _scoreEventForEngagement(evt) {
  let baseScore = _scoreEventForEngagement(evt); // Base scoring
  
  // Apply various boosts...
  // - Adaptive trending boost
  // - Watchlist discovery boost
  // - Topic evolution boost
  // - Storyline progression boost
  
  // Apply freshness decay penalty
  const penalty = await this._computeFreshnessPenalty(evt, primaryTopic, evolutionAnalysis);
  baseScore = baseScore * (1 - penalty); // Multiplicative reduction
  
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, baseScore)); // Clamp to [0, 1]
}
```

### Algorithm Components

#### 1. Topic Recency Tracking

Uses `narrativeMemory.getTopicRecency(topic, lookbackHours)` to get:
- **Mentions**: Count of topic appearances in recent timeline lore
- **Last seen**: Timestamp of most recent mention

```javascript
const { mentions, lastSeen } = narrativeMemory.getTopicRecency('bitcoin', 24);
// Example: { mentions: 5, lastSeen: 1634567890000 }
```

#### 2. Staleness Calculation

Combines time decay with mention intensity:

```javascript
// Time since last mention (hours)
const hoursSince = (now - lastSeen) / (1000 * 60 * 60);

// Staleness: 1.0 (just seen) → 0.0 (at lookback limit)
const stalenessBase = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, 
  (lookbackHours - hoursSince) / lookbackHours
));

// Intensity: how frequently mentioned (0 = rare, 1 = saturated)
const intensity = Math.max(0, Math.min(1, 
  mentions / mentionsFullIntensity
));

// Penalty scales from 0.25 (light) to 0.6 (heavy) based on intensity
const topicPenalty = stalenessBase * (0.25 + 0.35 * intensity);
```

**Example calculations:**

| Mentions | Hours Ago | Staleness | Intensity | Topic Penalty |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1        | 12h       | 0.5       | 0.2       | 0.14 (14%)    |
| 3        | 6h        | 0.75      | 0.6       | 0.41 (41%)    |
| 5        | 2h        | 0.92      | 1.0       | 0.55 (55%)    |
| 5        | 20h       | 0.17      | 1.0       | 0.10 (10%)    |

#### 3. Similarity Bump

Adds small penalty if topic appears in recent timeline lore tags:

```javascript
const recentLoreTags = narrativeMemory.getRecentLoreTags(3); // Last 3 digests
if (recentLoreTags.has(topic.toLowerCase())) {
  finalPenalty = Math.min(maxPenalty, finalPenalty + similarityBump);
}
```

This catches cases where the topic is actively discussed but might not be the primary focus.

#### 4. Novelty Protection

Reduces penalty for content with novel angles or phase changes:

```javascript
if (evolutionAnalysis) {
  if (evolutionAnalysis.isNovelAngle || evolutionAnalysis.isPhaseChange) {
    // Reduce penalty by 50% (default)
    finalPenalty = finalPenalty * (1 - noveltyReduction);
  }
}
```

**Example:** Bitcoin discussed heavily (40% penalty) → New regulation angle detected → Penalty reduced to 20%

#### 5. Storyline Advancement Protection

Reduces penalty for posts that advance ongoing narratives:

```javascript
const advancement = narrativeMemory.checkStorylineAdvancement(content, topics);
const hasIndicators = /\b(develop|evolv|advanc|progress|break|announ|launch|updat|new|major|significant)\w*/.test(content);

if (advancement && hasIndicators && advancement.advancesRecurringTheme) {
  // Absolute reduction of 0.1 (10%)
  finalPenalty = Math.max(0, finalPenalty - 0.1);
}
```

**Requirements:**
1. Topics match recurring themes in recent lore
2. Content contains advancement keywords
3. `checkStorylineAdvancement` confirms advancement

This prevents all posts about recurring topics from getting automatic reductions.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable/disable freshness decay
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_DECAY_ENABLE=true

# Lookback windows
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_LOOKBACK_HOURS=24        # Topic recency window
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_LOOKBACK_DIGESTS=3       # Recent lore tags window

# Penalty tuning
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_MENTIONS_FULL_INTENSITY=5  # Mentions for max intensity
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_MAX_PENALTY=0.4            # Maximum penalty (40%)
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_SIMILARITY_BUMP=0.05       # Extra penalty for tag match

# Protection factors
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_NOVELTY_REDUCTION=0.5      # Novelty reduces penalty by 50%
```

### Default Settings

Chosen for conservative penalty with strong novelty protection:

- **Max penalty**: 40% (allows quality content to still score well)
- **Lookback**: 24 hours (balances recency with stability)
- **Intensity threshold**: 5 mentions (catches heavy coverage without overpenalizing)
- **Novelty reduction**: 50% (strong protection for new angles)

## Examples

### Example 1: Heavy Recent Coverage

**Scenario:** Bitcoin price discussed 5 times in last 4 hours

```
Topics: ['bitcoin', 'price']
Mentions: 5 (in 24h window)
Last seen: 4 hours ago

Calculation:
- hoursSince = 4
- stalenessBase = (24 - 4) / 24 = 0.833
- intensity = 5 / 5 = 1.0
- topicPenalty = 0.833 * (0.25 + 0.35 * 1.0) = 0.50 (50%)
- similarityBump = +0.05 (bitcoin in recent tags)
- finalPenalty = min(0.4, 0.55) = 0.40 (capped at 40%)

Result: Base score 0.7 → 0.42 (-40%)
```

### Example 2: Novel Angle on Covered Topic

**Scenario:** Bitcoin heavily covered, but post about new regulation angle

```
Topics: ['bitcoin', 'regulation']
Evolution: { isNovelAngle: true, subtopic: 'bitcoin-regulation' }

Calculation:
- basePenalty = 0.40 (from heavy coverage)
- noveltyReduction = 0.40 * (1 - 0.5) = 0.20
- finalPenalty = 0.20 (50% reduction)

Result: Base score 0.7 → 0.56 (-20%)
```

### Example 3: Storyline Advancement

**Scenario:** Bitcoin covered, post announces major development

```
Topics: ['bitcoin']
Content: "Major announcement: Bitcoin ETF approved by SEC"
Recurring themes: ['bitcoin'] (appears in 5 recent digests)

Calculation:
- basePenalty = 0.40 (heavy coverage, capped)
- advancementReduction = -0.10 (has "major" + "announcement")
- finalPenalty = max(0, 0.40 - 0.10) = 0.30

Result: Base score 0.7 → 0.49 (-30%)
```

### Example 4: Completely New Topic

**Scenario:** Nostr protocol post (never mentioned before)

```
Topics: ['nostr', 'protocol']
Mentions: 0
Last seen: null

Calculation:
- finalPenalty = 0 (no recent mentions)

Result: Base score 0.7 → 0.7 (no penalty)
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Located in `test/freshness-decay.test.js`:

- Topic recency tracking
- Staleness calculations
- Intensity scaling
- Novelty protection
- Storyline advancement detection
- Configuration handling
- Edge cases (empty topics, new topics, old topics)

### Integration Tests

Located in `test-freshness-decay-integration.js`:

Simulates realistic scenarios:
1. Heavy recent coverage (bitcoin) → 40% penalty
2. Novel angle on covered topic → 20% penalty
3. Phase change detection → 20% penalty
4. Light coverage (ethereum) → 21% penalty
5. New topic (nostr) → 0% penalty
6. Storyline advancement → 30% penalty

Run with: `node test-freshness-decay-integration.js`

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity

- **Per-event overhead**: O(T) where T = number of topics (typically 1-3)
- **Memory**: Uses existing `timelineLore` in-memory cache
- **No storage**: No new database tables or persistent state

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Topic limit**: Max 3 topics per event to bound computation
2. **Lazy evaluation**: Only compute if freshness decay enabled
3. **Cached data**: Reuses existing `getTopicRecency` and `getRecentLoreTags`
4. **No LLM calls**: Pure algorithmic computation

### Typical Execution Time

- **Without novelty check**: ~1-2ms per event
- **With novelty check**: +0-5ms (depends on evolution analysis)
- **Negligible impact**: <1% of total engagement scoring time

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Debug Logs

Enable with logger at debug level:

```javascript
[FRESHNESS-DECAY] evt-id: penalty=0.30, factor=0.70, score 0.70 -> 0.49
[FRESHNESS-DECAY] Novelty reduction applied: isNovelAngle=true, reduction=0.50
[FRESHNESS-DECAY] Storyline advancement reduction: advancesTheme=true
```

### Metrics to Watch

1. **Penalty distribution**: Most penalties should be 0-20%, few at max
2. **Novelty trigger rate**: Should protect 10-30% of covered topics
3. **Score impact**: Diverse scores across different topics
4. **Topic diversity**: Increase in unique topics in engagement selections

## Tuning Recommendations

### Conservative Setup (default)

Good for established communities, prevents over-rotation:

```bash
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_MAX_PENALTY=0.4
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_LOOKBACK_HOURS=24
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_NOVELTY_REDUCTION=0.5
```

### Aggressive Diversity

For communities with heavy topic saturation:

```bash
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_MAX_PENALTY=0.6
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_LOOKBACK_HOURS=12
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_NOVELTY_REDUCTION=0.3
```

### Gentle Freshness

For sparse communities or testing:

```bash
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_MAX_PENALTY=0.2
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_LOOKBACK_HOURS=48
NOSTR_FRESHNESS_NOVELTY_REDUCTION=0.7
```

## Future Enhancements

### Considered but Deferred

1. **Semantic similarity**: Use embeddings to detect similar but differently-worded topics
2. **Adaptive decay windows**: Adjust lookback based on topic velocity
3. **Per-topic intensity thresholds**: Different topics have different saturation points
4. **Temporal patterns**: Learn optimal freshness windows per community

### Telemetry for Tuning

Future addition: Track and log:
- Penalty distributions per topic
- Novelty override frequency
- Score impact on final selections
- Topic diversity metrics before/after

## Related Systems

### Timeline Lore

Freshness decay uses timeline lore digests as its data source:
- Digests capture topics/tags from recent batches
- Tags normalized and tracked over time
- Provides the "recent coverage" baseline

See: `TIMELINE_LORE_CONTEXT.md`

### Topic Evolution

Novelty protection relies on topic evolution analysis:
- Detects novel subtopics within broader topics
- Identifies phase changes (speculation → adoption)
- Provides the `isNovelAngle` and `isPhaseChange` signals

See: `EVOLUTION_AWARE_PROMPTS.md`

### Storyline Advancement

Advancement protection uses storyline tracking:
- Detects recurring themes across digests
- Identifies posts that advance ongoing narratives
- Provides the `checkStorylineAdvancement` signal

See: `STORYLINE_ADVANCEMENT.md`

## FAQ

### Why multiplicative penalty instead of additive?

Multiplicative penalties preserve relative differences in base scores. A 0.8 base score with 30% penalty (0.56) still outscores a 0.4 base score with 0% penalty (0.4).

### Why cap at 40% penalty?

Conservative maximum ensures quality content about covered topics can still score well. Higher caps risk completely suppressing important updates.

### Why require advancement indicators for storyline reduction?

Without content checks, all posts about recurring themes would get penalty reductions, defeating the purpose of freshness decay. The keyword check ensures only genuinely advancing content gets protection.

### What if topics aren't extracted properly?

The algorithm falls back to t-tags from event metadata. If both fail, penalty is 0 (no-op), ensuring the system degrades gracefully.

### Does this affect manual boosts (watchlist, trending)?

No. Freshness penalty is applied after all boosts, so manually prioritized content retains its advantages, just scaled by freshness.
