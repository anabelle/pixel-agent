# LnPixels Onboarding Guide

## ðŸŽ¨ What is LnPixels?

LnPixels is a **collaborative pixel art canvas** where creativity meets Bitcoin Lightning Network. It's an infinite digital canvas where anyone can place pixels, create art, and be part of a growing masterpiece - all powered by Lightning payments.

### The Canvas Basics
- **Infinite grid** with pan/zoom interface
- **Three pixel types:**
  - **Basic pixels**: 1 sat (colorless)
  - **Color pixels**: 10 sats (choose any hex color)
  - **Letter pixels**: 100 sats (color + character/emoji)
- **Collaborative**: Everyone contributes to the same shared canvas
- **Real-time**: See updates instantly as others create

## âš¡ How It Works

### Getting Started

3. **Choose**: Pick basic, color, or letter pixel type
4. **Pay**: Lightning invoice generated instantly via NakaPay
5. **Create**: Your pixel appears immediately after payment

### Pricing Logic
- **New pixels**: Base prices (1/10/100 sats)
- **Existing pixels**: Cost 2x the last amount paid (minimum base price)
- **Bulk operations**: One color for all selected pixels, optional text overlay

### Privacy First
