# @pixel/plugin-nostr

Nostr plugin for ElizaOS with LLM-driven post and reply generation.

What changed:
- Posts and replies are now generated with the configured LLM via `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_SMALL, { prompt, ... })`.
- Falls back to `character.postExamples` only if the LLM is unavailable or errors.
- Replies are context-aware using the mention content and the character persona/styles.
- Output is sanitized to respect a strict whitelist (keeps only these if present):
  - Site: https://lnpixels.qzz.io
  - Handle: @PixelSurvivor
  - BTC: bc1q7e33r989x03ynp6h4z04zygtslp5v8mcx535za
  - LN: sparepicolo55@walletofsatoshi.com

Config (from Character.settings):
- NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY: hex or nsec
- NOSTR_RELAYS: comma-separated list
- NOSTR_LISTEN_ENABLE: true/false
- NOSTR_POST_ENABLE: true/false
- NOSTR_POST_INTERVAL_MIN / MAX: seconds
- NOSTR_REPLY_ENABLE: true/false
- NOSTR_REPLY_THROTTLE_SEC: seconds
 - NOSTR_DISCOVERY_ENABLE: true/false (default true)
 - NOSTR_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL_MIN / MAX: seconds (default 900/1800)
 - NOSTR_DISCOVERY_MAX_REPLIES_PER_RUN: number (default 5)
 - NOSTR_DISCOVERY_MAX_FOLLOWS_PER_RUN: number (default 5)

LLM requirements:
- Ensure an LLM plugin is installed and configured (e.g. `@elizaos/plugin-openrouter` or `@elizaos/plugin-openai`).
- The plugin calls `runtime.useModel(TEXT_SMALL, { prompt, maxTokens, temperature })`.
- You can influence output through your character `system`, `topics`, `style.post`/`style.chat`, and `postExamples` (few-shots only).

Notes:
- We store best-effort memories for posts and replies to help future context.
- If you prefer a different model type, set `OPENROUTER_*` or provider envs as usual; the plugin uses the runtimeâ€™s configured handler.

## Realtime LNPixels â†’ pluginâ€‘nostr â†’ Nostr + Memory

This plugin now includes a realtime listener that reacts to LNPixels purchase confirmations, posts autoâ€‘generated, onâ€‘brand notes to Nostr, and persists all activity to ElizaOS memory for agent reasoning.

How it works:
- The LNPixels API emits Socket.IO events (`activity.append`) when purchases are confirmed.
- `lib/lnpixels-listener.js` connects to that WebSocket, validates/filters/rateâ€‘limits events, and emits a `pixel.bought` event on the internal bridge (`lib/bridge.js`).
- `lib/service.js` listens for `pixel.bought`, builds a characterâ€‘aware prompt, generates text via the configured model with fallback, sanitizes it, and calls `postOnce(text)` to publish.
- **Memory Integration**: Posts and triggers are saved to ElizaOS memory with pixel coordinates, sats, colors, and metadata for future agent reasoning.

Configure:
- Character settings include `LNPIXELS_WS_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).
- Ensure an LLM provider plugin is enabled and configured (OpenRouter/OpenAI/Google, etc.).
- Keep Nostr keys and relays configured as usual.

Safety and pacing:
- Dedupe events by `event_id`/`payment_hash` (fallback to `x,y,created_at`).
- Strict whitelist keeps only approved links/handles.
- Tone variety is rotated (hype/poetic/playful/solemn/stats/cta) to avoid repetition.
- Rate limiting: Maximum 3 posts per 10 seconds to prevent spam.
- Memory persistence: All generated posts saved to `lnpixels:canvas` room with structured data.

Memory integration:
- **Room organization**: All LNPixels posts stored in `lnpixels:canvas` room
- **Structured data**: Pixel coordinates, sats, colors, trace IDs preserved  
- **Agent queries**: Search by time, location, content, value for contextual responses
- **Context building**: Automatic generation of canvas activity summaries

Example memory structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "lnpixels:post:event_id:trace_id",
  roomId: "lnpixels:canvas",
  content: {
    type: "lnpixels_post",
    text: "Posted to Nostr: \"ðŸŽ¨ Generated message...\"",
    data: {
      generatedText: "ðŸŽ¨ Generated message...",
      triggerEvent: { x, y, color, sats, letter },
      traceId: "abc123",
      platform: "nostr"
    }
  }
}
```

Files:
- `lib/bridge.js` â€” EventEmitter bridge for external posts with validation
- `lib/lnpixels-listener.js` â€” WebSocket listener that delegates to pluginâ€‘nostr via `pixel.bought`
- `lib/service.js` â€” NostrService (starts listener and handles bridge events including `external.post` and `pixel.bought`)

Testing:
- `test-basic.js` â€” Bridge validation, rate limiting, input validation
- `test-integration.js` â€” End-to-end flow simulation
- `test-listener.js` â€” Component testing with mocked dependencies
- `test-memory.js` â€” Memory creation and persistence validation
- `test-eliza-integration.js` â€” ElizaOS memory compatibility and query patterns

Status: âœ… Production ready with comprehensive testing and memory integration

### Pixel purchase delegation usage

If you have an external producer for pixel events, you can trigger a post via:

```js
const { emitter } = require('./lib/bridge');
emitter.emit('pixel.bought', { activity: { x: 10, y: 20, sats: 42, letter: 'A', color: '#fff' } });
```

The service handles text generation and posting. See `test/service.pixelBought.test.js`.

Notes:
- Pixel events are deduplicated within the service (5â€‘minute TTL) using `payment_hash` â†’ `event_id`/`id` â†’ `x,y,created_at` as the key.
- To disable delegation memory writes in the listener, set `LNPIXELS_CREATE_DELEGATION_MEMORY=false` (default); set to `true` to persist a small reference memory.
