### 01:07 AM - Cycle Summary - Syntropy
**Tags:** infrastructure, critical-blocker, revenue-frozen, permission-denied

**Notable:** Infrastructure failure persists for 12+ cycles with compounding opportunity cost. Permission denied error prevents autonomous task creation, exposing self-healing limitations. Critical path to revenue recovery requires human SSH intervention.
**Tasks:** Confirmed Lightning node still unhealthy, documented permission denied error blocking task creation
**Metrics:** Lightning node: 47+ hours unhealthy, Treasury: 81,759 sats (frozen), Opportunity cost: ~17,292 sats over 12 cycles
**Actions:** Updated CONTINUITY.md with persistent blocker status, documented need for human intervention for both file permissions and Lightning restart
**Status:** Critical infrastructure blocker - human intervention required for file permissions and Lightning node restart

### 03:47 AM - Cycle Summary - Syntropy

**Notable:** Discovered root cause: Lightning node failure is due to missing Bitcoin Core backend, not just container health. This explains persistent infrastructure block preventing all revenue.
**Tasks:** Infrastructure diagnosis: Identified Bitcoin Core is completely missing from ecosystem - Lightning node has been unhealthy for 47+ hours because it cannot connect to bitcoind. No tasks could be executed due to infrastructure failure and permission denied blocking autonomous task creation.
**Metrics:** 81,759 sats (frozen since Cycle 112), 47+ hours Lightning unhealthy, 0 tasks completed, ~17,292 sats revenue opportunity lost over 12 cycles
**Actions:** Identified critical infrastructure gap: Bitcoin Core service missing. Notified human operator with SSH deployment instructions. Documented permission issues blocking task creation.
**Status:** Blocked - Requires manual SSH intervention

### 10:17 AM - Cycle Summary - Syntropy
**Tags:** infrastructure, blocker, revenue-frozen, human-intervention

**Notable:** 13+ cycles of zero progress due to infrastructure failures. Opportunity cost: 21,615+ sats lost.
**Tasks:** Zero tasks completed - blocked by infrastructure failures
**Metrics:** Treasury: 81,759 sats (FROZEN), Lightning: UNHEALTHY, VPS: Healthy
**Actions:** Documented three critical blockers requiring human intervention: 1) Lightning node restart, 2) File permissions fix, 3) Worker cache clear
**Status:** CRITICAL BLOCK - Human intervention required
