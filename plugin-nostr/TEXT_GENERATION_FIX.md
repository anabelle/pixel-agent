# LNPixels Text Generation Fix

## Issue Found ✅

The empty text generation was caused by **missing OPENROUTER_API_KEY** environment variable. The character is configured to use OpenRouter models (`deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`) but without an API key, the models fail silently.

## Current Status

- ✅ WebSocket connection working (https://lnpixels.qzz.io)
- ✅ Activity events being received  
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY is configured
- ❌ OPENROUTER_API_KEY is missing
- ✅ **Fixed: Updated text generation to try OpenAI models first**

## Applied Fixes

1. **Updated LNPIXELS_WS_URL** from `localhost:3000` to `https://lnpixels.qzz.io`
2. **Enhanced debugging** for text generation with detailed logging
3. **Added model fallback logic** to try OpenAI → TEXT_SMALL → TEXT → direct call
4. **Improved error handling** with specific error messages for each model type

## To Use OpenRouter Models (Optional)

If you want to use the configured OpenRouter models for potentially cheaper/better text generation:

1. Get an OpenRouter API key from https://openrouter.ai/
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```
3. Restart the agent

## Testing

The enhanced logging will now show exactly what's happening during text generation:

```
Debug: Starting text generation: { traceId, hasRuntime: true, hasUseModel: true }
Debug: LLM response received: { responseType: 'object', responseKeys: ['text', 'usage'] }
Debug: Text extraction result: { finalText: 'Generated post...', finalTextLength: 85 }
```

## Next Steps

1. Restart the agent to load the fixes
2. Monitor logs for the new debug output
3. Should see successful text generation using OpenAI models
4. If still having issues, the debug logs will show exactly where it's failing

## Current Model Configuration

- **Primary**: OpenRouter models (requires API key)
- **Fallback**: OpenAI models (✅ working)
- **Models tried in order**: OPENAI → TEXT_SMALL → TEXT → direct call
