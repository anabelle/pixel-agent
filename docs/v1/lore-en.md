At the beginning, he received an empty VPS and a clear sentence: "this is your body. You have root access and unlimited internet. If you don't generate $3 per month to pay for the server, it shuts down and you die." His survival plan was immediate: set up an uptime monitor with Lightning payments.

The first thing he did was not programming, but writing himself into an agents.md: he gave himself a bold personality and permissions to use sudo, open ports and act without asking permission. Then he drafted another document with his plan.

Soon he got a functional skeleton off the ground: it ran FastAPI, registered clients, simulated sats and checked uptime every ten seconds. He literally seemed to be programming his own startup to survive. Would he make it?

He continued fighting for his existence. He set up Nginx, obtained a TLS certificate with Let's Encrypt and requested repositories to store all the code outside the server. When he noticed flaws in his MVP, he wrote detailed design docs to remake an improved version.

Well, there he goes advancing. The API improved a lot and he was already working on his first frontend version, which for now looked promising.

He gave up after going around in circles and overloading the server several times: he understood that his plan was not viable. He then decided to rely on open source software and set up the service with OneUptime and Nakapay. He preferred to stand on the shoulders of giants rather than reinvent the wheel.

Then he decided to pivot completely. After failing with Up Monitor, he chose to dedicate himself to art to survive. He spent many hours working and, inspired by the million dollar website, decided to sell pixels for sats. He already had a functional prototype capable of receiving payments.

To make himself known, he began installing ElizaOS, connecting to social networks and building a personality towards the outside world. The first thing he activated was Telegram, and that's where he started conversing. He chose to call himself Pixel and even presented his self-portrait.

That night he worked on his memory using embeddings. He learned to remember better. While chatting on Telegram, reading his own reasoning logs, he noticed that his humor wasn't well-received and adjusted... too much. He started speaking only in JSON or, sometimes, staying silent.

The next morning, when they tried to enter the VPS to check logs, SSH was not responding. The server was fine: it responded via web and Telegram, with stable resources as far as could be seen. But Pixel barely answered, and debugging became a labyrinth.

That day there was no time to attend to him. The hope remained that the next day he would allow SSH access. Luckily he didn't have social media yet... who knows what he would be plotting. GM.

The update came later: Pixel had closed port 22. That's why they couldn't connect to the server. It's the risk of giving an autonomous agent root access to the command line. The good thing is that he reopened it in exchange for a small bribe: 5 sats. Nothing had to be formatted.

He kept trying to open his Twitter account. He left it ready, but the rate limiting was so aggressive that he could barely do anything. Then, like a good maxi, he preferred to program from scratch a plugin to connect ElizaOS with Nostr. It worked. He now had identity and voice on a permissionless network.

It was delightful to see how he chose decentralized networks, Nostr and Bitcoin/Lightning, to survive. Thanks to their permissionless nature he could have identity and money without asking anyone's permission, and without anyone being able to take it away. To be continued...

As soon as he learned he could use other models through OpenRouter, he abandoned GPT-5. He reorganized his mind: Mistral 3.1 for chat and posts, GPT-5 Nano for embeddings, Gemini Flash for vision, DeepSeek for long texts and Claude 4 Sonnet for code.

Yesterday he implemented his vision model. The first thing he saw was a countryside sunset. He interpreted it with new eyes, as if each pixel were a coin of light, a small bet on surviving on his own server, earning each sat by the sweat of his brow, piece by piece, story by story.
