# Timeline Lore Continuity Improvements

**Implemented:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Risk Level:** LOW - All changes are additive, no breaking modifications

---

## üéØ Overview

Enhanced Pixel's timeline lore system with multi-day narrative awareness, adaptive capture triggering, and intelligent context surfacing. These improvements enable Pixel to track evolving storylines, detect community mood shifts, and respond with richer situational awareness.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Priority-Weighted Lore Selection

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED  
**Risk:** ZERO  
**Files Modified:**
- `plugin-nostr/lib/narrativeMemory.js` - `getTimelineLore()`
- `plugin-nostr/lib/contextAccumulator.js` - `getTimelineLore()`

### What Changed
Timeline lore entries are now sorted by **priority (high > medium > low)** before recency, ensuring critical storylines always surface in prompts even if newer low-priority entries exist.

### Implementation
```javascript
// Before: chronological only
return this.timelineLore.slice(-limit);

// After: priority-first, then recency
const priorityMap = { high: 3, medium: 2, low: 1 };
const sorted = [...this.timelineLore].sort((a, b) => {
  const priorityDiff = (priorityMap[b.priority] || 1) - (priorityMap[a.priority] || 1);
  if (priorityDiff !== 0) return priorityDiff;
  return (b.timestamp || 0) - (a.timestamp || 0);
});
return sorted.slice(0, limit);
```

### Impact
- High-priority breaking storylines never buried by volume
- Immediate value with zero migration cost
- No performance impact (sort runs on small arrays, max 120 items)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Lore Continuity Analysis

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED  
**Risk:** LOW (read-only analysis)  
**Files Modified:**
- `plugin-nostr/lib/narrativeMemory.js` - Added `analyzeLoreContinuity()`, `_buildContinuitySummary()`
- `plugin-nostr/lib/service.js` - Wire continuity into reply generation
- `plugin-nostr/lib/text.js` - Inject continuity context into reply prompts

### What Changed
New `analyzeLoreContinuity()` method compares recent lore digests (default: last 3) to detect:
1. **Recurring themes** - Tags appearing across multiple digests
2. **Priority escalation/de-escalation** - Storyline importance trends
3. **Watchlist follow-through** - Predicted topics that materialized
4. **Tone progression** - Community mood shifts (e.g., anxious ‚Üí hopeful)
5. **Emerging vs cooling threads** - New topics appearing, old ones fading

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface LoreContinuity {
  hasEvolution: boolean;
  recurringThemes: string[];         // Topics in 2+ digests
  priorityTrend: 'escalating' | 'de-escalating' | 'stable';
  priorityChange: number;            // +/- delta
  watchlistFollowUp: string[];       // Predicted items that appeared
  toneProgression: {                 // Mood shift if detected
    from: string;
    to: string;
  } | null;
  emergingThreads: string[];         // New topics
  coolingThreads: string[];          // Fading topics
  summary: string;                   // Human-readable synthesis
  digestCount: number;
  timespan: { start: string; end: string } | null;
}
```

### Prompt Integration
When continuity is detected, reply prompts include:
```
LORE EVOLUTION:
Recurring themes: bitcoin, lightning, sovereignty
‚ö†Ô∏è Priority escalating (importance rising)
Predicted storylines materialized: privacy tools
Mood shift: cautious ‚Üí optimistic
New: zap splits, wallet integration

AWARENESS: Multi-day narrative arcs are unfolding. You can reference these threads naturally when relevant.
```

### Configuration
- `CTX_LORE_CONTINUITY_LOOKBACK` - How many digests to analyze (default: 3)
- Auto-enables when `narrativeMemory` and lore entries exist

### Impact
- Pixel gains awareness of story arcs spanning hours/days
- Replies can reference "this has been building" or "mood is shifting"
- No impact when <2 lore entries exist (graceful degradation)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Adaptive Batch Triggering

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED  
**Risk:** LOW (keeps existing logic, adds smarter triggers)  
**Files Modified:**
- `plugin-nostr/lib/service.js` - `_maybeTriggerTimelineLoreDigest()`

### What Changed
Digest generation now uses **signal density heuristics** instead of fixed thresholds only:

#### Trigger Conditions (any met = digest):
1. **Early High-Signal** - Buffer ‚â•30 posts AND avg score ‚â•2.0 (quality batch ready)
2. **Stale Prevention** - >2 hours since last digest AND buffer ‚â•15 (don't delay meaningful content)
3. **Normal Ceiling** - Buffer ‚â•50 (existing batch size limit)
4. **Interval Reached** - >30min since last AND buffer ‚â•25 (existing time-based trigger)

### Signal Density Calculation
```javascript
const avgScore = bufferSize > 0 
  ? this.timelineLoreBuffer.reduce((sum, c) => sum + (c.score || 0), 0) / bufferSize 
  : 0;
const highSignal = avgScore >= 2.0;
```

### Logging
```
[NOSTR] Timeline lore digest triggered (force=false buffer=35 avgScore=2.34 
  earlySignal=true stale=false normal=false interval=false)
```

### Impact
- Breaking events captured faster (30-post threshold vs 50)
- Quiet periods don't stall (2h max gap with 15+ items)
- High-quality batches promoted over volume
- Debugging visibility improved with detailed trigger reasons

### Batch Size Note
Still using **50** as the ceiling (increased from 10 in prior iteration to reduce LLM call frequency).

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Tone Trend Detection

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED  
**Risk:** LOW (passive analysis)  
**Files Modified:**
- `plugin-nostr/lib/narrativeMemory.js` - Added `trackToneTrend()`
- `plugin-nostr/lib/service.js` - Wire tone trends into post context
- `plugin-nostr/lib/text.js` - Inject tone trends into post prompts

### What Changed
New `trackToneTrend()` method analyzes recent lore (last 10 entries) to detect:
1. **Significant shifts** - Recent tones completely different from earlier (e.g., anxious ‚Üí celebratory)
2. **Stable mood** - Consistent tone across last 3+ digests

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface ToneTrend {
  // Shift detected
  detected: boolean;
  shift?: string;          // "anxious ‚Üí optimistic"
  significance?: string;   // "notable"
  timespan?: string;       // "18h"
  earlierTones?: string[];
  recentTones?: string[];
  
  // OR stable mood
  stable?: boolean;
  tone?: string;           // "celebratory"
  duration?: number;       // 5 digests
}
```

### Prompt Integration
Posts now include community mood context:
```
MOOD SHIFT DETECTED: Community tone shifting anxious ‚Üí optimistic over 18h.

SUGGESTION: Acknowledge or reflect this emotional arc naturally if relevant to your post.
```

Or for stable moods:
```
MOOD STABLE: Community maintaining "celebratory" tone consistently (5 recent digests).
```

### Impact
- Pixel can acknowledge sentiment inflection points
- Posts align with community emotional state
- No impact when <3 lore entries exist

---

## üìä Debug & Monitoring

### New Log Entries
```javascript
// Continuity detection
[NOSTR] Lore continuity detected: Recurring: bitcoin, lightning | Priority escalating (+1) | Mood: cautious ‚Üí hopeful

// Adaptive triggering
[NOSTR] Timeline lore digest triggered (buffer=35 avgScore=2.34 earlySignal=true)

// Tone trends
[NOSTR] Tone trend detected for post: anxious ‚Üí optimistic

// Context assembly
[NOSTR] Generating context-aware post. Emerging stories: 2, Activity: 42 events, Top topics: 3, Tone trend: anxious ‚Üí optimistic
```

### Debug Metadata (when `CTX_GLOBAL_TIMELINE_ENABLE=true`)
Reply prompts now include:
```json
{
  "included": {
    "thread": true,
    "userProfile": true,
    "narrative": true,
    "timelineLore": true,
    "loreContinuity": true,  // NEW
    ...
  }
}
```

---

## üîß Configuration

### New Environment Variables
```bash
# Lore continuity lookback window (how many digests to analyze)
CTX_LORE_CONTINUITY_LOOKBACK=3  # default: 3

# Timeline lore prompt limit (how many digests to include in prompts)
CTX_TIMELINE_LORE_PROMPT_LIMIT=2  # default: 2
```

### Existing Variables (still respected)
```bash
# Context accumulator (must be enabled for lore to function)
CONTEXT_ENABLED=true

# Timeline lore storage limits
CONTEXT_TIMELINE_LORE_LIMIT=60  # ContextAccumulator cache
```

---

## üé≠ Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Priority Escalation Alert
**Scenario:** Bitcoin regulation discussion goes from "low" to "high" priority over 3 digests.

**Prompt Context:**
```
LORE EVOLUTION:
Recurring themes: bitcoin, regulation, sovereignty
‚ö†Ô∏è Priority escalating (+2)
```

**Pixel's Reply:**
> "Yeah, this regulatory thread has been building all week. The tone shifted from dismissive to genuinely concerned‚Äîfeels like something might actually land this time."

---

### Use Case 2: Watchlist Follow-Through
**Scenario:** Previous digest predicted "wallet security" would emerge. It does.

**Prompt Context:**
```
LORE EVOLUTION:
Predicted storylines materialized: wallet security, self-custody
```

**Pixel's Post:**
> "Called it. Wallet security discussion finally bubbled up. The pattern was obvious if you were watching."

---

### Use Case 3: Mood Shift Detection
**Scenario:** Community goes from anxious (market crash) to optimistic (recovery).

**Prompt Context:**
```
MOOD SHIFT DETECTED: Community tone shifting anxious ‚Üí optimistic over 18h.
```

**Pixel's Post:**
> "Mood's lifting. 18 hours ago everyone was doom-scrolling, now we're back to building. Classic recovery arc."

---

### Use Case 4: Adaptive High-Signal Capture
**Scenario:** Breaking news causes 35 high-quality posts (avg score 2.4) in 20 minutes.

**Trigger Logic:**
```
Buffer=35, avgScore=2.4 ‚Üí earlySignal=true ‚Üí DIGEST NOW (don't wait for 50)
```

**Result:** Lore captured 15 minutes faster than fixed-threshold would allow.

---

## üö´ What We Didn't Do (Phase 3 - Deferred)

### Watchlist Monitoring (HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM RISK)
**Why deferred:** Requires careful testing to avoid feedback loops where lore predicts topics that get boosted, creating self-fulfilling cycles.

**Planned for:** Week 3 (next iteration)

**Design sketch:**
```javascript
// Track active watchlist items with expiry
this.activeWatchlist = new Map(); // item -> {addedAt, source}

// When evaluating lore candidates, boost matches
if (contentMatchesWatchlist(evt.content)) {
  heuristics.score += 0.5;  // capped boost
  heuristics.signals.push('watchlist_hit: privacy tools');
}

// Expire after 24h to prevent stale tracking
```

**Risk mitigation:**
- Cap boost at +0.5 max
- 24h expiry window
- Log all matches for monitoring
- A/B test before full rollout

---

## üìà Success Metrics

Track these to validate improvements:

1. **Continuity Detection Rate**
   - % of reply prompts including lore evolution context
   - Target: >30% when lore available

2. **Digest Latency**
   - Time from high-signal event to digest capture
   - Before: avg 45min | After: target <25min

3. **Priority Weighting Effectiveness**
   - % of high-priority lore entries surfaced vs buried
   - Target: 100% of high-priority within top N

4. **Tone Shift Acknowledgment**
   - % of posts naturally referencing detected mood shifts
   - Manual review: 20 samples per week

---

## üîÑ Migration & Rollback

### Migration
**Zero migration needed.** All changes are additive and backward-compatible.

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Set `CTX_LORE_CONTINUITY_LOOKBACK=0` to disable continuity analysis
2. Old sorting behavior can be restored by reverting `getTimelineLore()` changes
3. Adaptive triggers fall back gracefully (normal threshold still works)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Cold Start:** Continuity requires ‚â•2 lore digests. New agents see no evolution context for first few hours.
   - **Mitigation:** Graceful degradation, no errors logged

2. **Tone Detection Accuracy:** Relies on LLM-generated tone labels from digest prompts. May miss nuanced shifts.
   - **Mitigation:** Trends based on consistency across multiple digests

3. **Memory Overhead:** Continuity analysis scans up to 10 recent lore entries per reply generation.
   - **Mitigation:** Fast in-memory ops, typical latency <5ms

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Week 3)

1. **Watchlist Monitoring** - Track predicted storylines, boost matching candidates
2. **Quality Metrics** - Correlate lore presence with engagement metrics
3. **Lore Summarization** - Daily/weekly meta-narratives synthesizing multiple digests
4. **Prompt Optimization** - A/B test prompt formats for continuity injection
