# @pixel/plugin-nostr

Nostr plugin for ElizaOS with LLM-driven post and reply generation.

## üéØ Key Features

### Centralized Posting Queue
All posts, replies, and interactions are now managed through a **centralized posting queue** that ensures natural, organic-looking activity patterns:
- **Priority-based posting**: Mentions are prioritized over discovery and scheduled posts
- **Natural rate limiting**: Posts are spaced 15s-2min apart (configurable)
- **No batching**: Prevents unnatural bursts of replies/reactions
- **Collision prevention**: Scheduled posts don't conflict with pixel purchases or mentions
- See [POSTING_QUEUE.md](./POSTING_QUEUE.md) for detailed documentation

Configuration:
```bash
NOSTR_MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_POSTS_MS=15000      # Min 15s between posts
NOSTR_MAX_DELAY_BETWEEN_POSTS_MS=120000     # Max 2min natural variance
NOSTR_MENTION_PRIORITY_BOOST_MS=5000        # Mentions wait 5s less
```

What changed:
- Posts and replies are now generated with the configured LLM via `runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_SMALL, { prompt, ... })`.
- Falls back to `character.postExamples` only if the LLM is unavailable or errors.
- Replies are context-aware using the mention content and the character persona/styles.
- Output is sanitized to respect a strict whitelist (keeps only these if present):
  - Site: https://ln.pixel.xx.kg
  - Handle: @PixelSurvivor
  - BTC: bc1q7e33r989x03ynp6h4z04zygtslp5v8mcx535za

## Home Feed Interactions

The plugin now includes home feed monitoring and automated interactions with posts from followed users:

**Features:**
- **Real-time subscription**: Monitors posts from all followed users in real-time
- **Quality filtering**: Only interacts with posts that pass quality checks (length, content, recency)
- **Multiple interaction types**:
  - **Reactions** (üëç): Simple likes on quality posts
  - **Reposts**: Shares posts from followed users
  - **Quote reposts**: Adds commentary when reposting
- **Configurable probabilities**: Control how often each type of interaction occurs
- **Rate limiting**: Maximum interactions per check cycle to avoid spam
- **Deduplication**: Tracks processed events to avoid duplicate interactions

**How it works:**
1. Subscribes to posts from all users in your contact list
2. Filters posts for quality (avoids spam, bots, low-quality content)
3. Randomly selects interaction type based on configured probabilities
4. Generates quote text using LLM for quote reposts
5. Publishes interactions to Nostr relays

**Configuration:**
- Set `NOSTR_HOME_FEED_REACTION_CHANCE=0.15` for 15% chance to react to posts
- Set `NOSTR_HOME_FEED_REPOST_CHANCE=0.05` for 5% chance to repost
- Set `NOSTR_HOME_FEED_QUOTE_CHANCE=0.02` for 2% chance to quote repost
- Adjust `NOSTR_HOME_FEED_MAX_INTERACTIONS=3` to limit interactions per cycle
- Control check frequency with `NOSTR_HOME_FEED_INTERVAL_MIN/MAX`

**Safety features:**
- Never interacts with own posts
- Quality filtering prevents spam interactions
- Rate limiting prevents overwhelming relays
- LLM-generated quote text respects character persona and whitelist

## Unfollow Management

The plugin includes intelligent unfollow functionality to maintain feed quality by automatically unfollowing users who consistently post low-quality content:

**Features:**
- **Quality tracking**: Monitors quality scores for all followed users based on their post content
- **Automatic unfollow**: Unfollows users who fall below quality thresholds after sufficient observation
- **Configurable thresholds**: Control when to unfollow based on quality scores and post counts
- **Periodic checks**: Runs unfollow checks at configurable intervals to avoid constant processing
- **Rate limiting**: Limits unfollows per check cycle to prevent aggressive behavior
- **Data cleanup**: Removes tracking data for unfollowed users

**How it works:**
1. Tracks quality scores for each followed user based on their posts
2. Maintains running averages of quality scores over time
3. Periodically checks for users below quality thresholds
4. Unfollows low-quality users and updates contact list
5. Cleans up tracking data for unfollowed users

**Configuration:**
- Set `NOSTR_UNFOLLOW_ENABLE=true` to enable automatic unfollowing
- Set `NOSTR_UNFOLLOW_MIN_QUALITY_SCORE=0.3` for minimum quality score (0.0-1.0)
- Set `NOSTR_UNFOLLOW_MIN_POSTS_THRESHOLD=5` for minimum posts before considering unfollow
- Set `NOSTR_UNFOLLOW_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS=24` for how often to check (1-168 hours)
- Set `NOSTR_UNFOLLOW_ADD_TO_MUTE=true` to automatically add unfollowed users to mute list (prevents rediscovery)

**Quality scoring:**
- Posts are scored based on content quality (length, relevance, engagement potential)
- Running averages prevent single bad posts from triggering unfollows
- Only users with sufficient post history are considered for unfollowing
- Quality filtering uses the same criteria as home feed interactions

**Mute list integration:**
- When `NOSTR_UNFOLLOW_ADD_TO_MUTE=true` (default), unfollowed users are automatically added to the mute list
- This prevents the discovery process from rediscovering and refollowing them
- Muted users are automatically filtered out during discovery (existing behavior)
- If a muted user is manually unmuted, they can be rediscovered and followed again
- Mute operation errors are logged but don't prevent the unfollow from completing

**Safety features:**
- Only unfollows users with enough posts to establish patterns
- Rate limits unfollows (max 5 per check cycle)
- Preserves high-quality follows
- Logs all unfollow actions for transparency
- Graceful error handling prevents service disruption

LLM requirements:
- Ensure an LLM plugin is installed and configured (e.g. `@elizaos/plugin-openrouter` or `@elizaos/plugin-openai`).
- The plugin calls `runtime.useModel(TEXT_SMALL, { prompt, maxTokens, temperature })`.
- You can influence output through your character `system`, `topics`, `style.post`/`style.chat`, and `postExamples` (few-shots only).

Notes:
- We store best-effort memories for posts and replies to help future context.
- If you prefer a different model type, set `OPENROUTER_*` or provider envs as usual; the plugin uses the runtime‚Äôs configured handler.

## Realtime LNPixels ‚Üí plugin‚Äënostr ‚Üí Nostr + Memory

This plugin now includes a realtime listener that reacts to LNPixels purchase confirmations, posts auto‚Äëgenerated, on‚Äëbrand notes to Nostr, and persists all activity to ElizaOS memory for agent reasoning.

How it works:
- The LNPixels API emits Socket.IO events (`activity.append`) when purchases are confirmed.
- `lib/lnpixels-listener.js` connects to that WebSocket, validates/filters/rate‚Äëlimits events, and emits a `pixel.bought` event on the internal bridge (`lib/bridge.js`).
- `lib/service.js` listens for `pixel.bought`, builds a character‚Äëaware prompt, generates text via the configured model with fallback, sanitizes it, and calls `postOnce(text)` to publish.
- **Memory Integration**: Posts and triggers are saved to ElizaOS memory with pixel coordinates, sats, colors, and metadata for future agent reasoning.

Configure:
- Character settings include `LNPIXELS_WS_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).
- Ensure an LLM provider plugin is enabled and configured (OpenRouter/OpenAI/Google, etc.).
- Keep Nostr keys and relays configured as usual.

Safety and pacing:
- Dedupe events by `event_id`/`payment_hash` (fallback to `x,y,created_at`).
- Strict whitelist keeps only approved links/handles.
- Tone variety is rotated (hype/poetic/playful/solemn/stats/cta) to avoid repetition.
- Rate limiting: Maximum 3 posts per 10 seconds to prevent spam.
- Memory persistence: All generated posts saved to `lnpixels:canvas` room with structured data.

Memory integration:
- **Room organization**: All LNPixels posts stored in `lnpixels:canvas` room
- **Structured data**: Pixel coordinates, sats, colors, trace IDs preserved  
- **Agent queries**: Search by time, location, content, value for contextual responses
- **Context building**: Automatic generation of canvas activity summaries

Example memory structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "lnpixels:post:event_id:trace_id",
  roomId: "lnpixels:canvas",
  content: {
    type: "lnpixels_post",
    text: "Posted to Nostr: \"üé® Generated message...\"",
    data: {
      generatedText: "üé® Generated message...",
      triggerEvent: { x, y, color, sats, letter },
      traceId: "abc123",
      platform: "nostr"
    }
  }
}
```

Files:
- `lib/bridge.js` ,  EventEmitter bridge for external posts with validation
- `lib/lnpixels-listener.js` ,  WebSocket listener that delegates to plugin‚Äënostr via `pixel.bought`
- `lib/service.js` ,  NostrService (starts listener and handles bridge events including `external.post` and `pixel.bought`)

Testing:
- `test-basic.js` ,  Bridge validation, rate limiting, input validation
- `test-integration.js` ,  End-to-end flow simulation
- `test-listener.js` ,  Component testing with mocked dependencies
- `test-memory.js` ,  Memory creation and persistence validation
- `test-eliza-integration.js` ,  ElizaOS memory compatibility and query patterns

## Testing

Run tests from the plugin directory (not the monorepo root):

```powershell
cd .\plugin-nostr
npm run test
```

### Test Scripts

- **Basic tests**: `npm run test` - Run all tests once
- **Watch mode**: `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in interactive watch mode
- **Coverage**: `npm run test:coverage` - Generate comprehensive coverage reports
- **Coverage watch**: `npm run test:coverage:watch` - Coverage with watch mode

### Coverage Reporting

The test suite includes comprehensive code coverage reporting powered by [@vitest/coverage-v8](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage.html). Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
- **Text**: Summary printed to console
- **HTML**: Interactive browsable report in `coverage/index.html`
- **JSON**: Machine-readable data for CI integration
- **LCOV**: Compatible with external coverage services (Codecov, Coveralls, etc.)

Coverage is configured to analyze all source files in `lib/` with the following quality thresholds:
- Lines: 80%
- Functions: 80%
- Branches: 80%
- Statements: 80%

To view the HTML coverage report:
```powershell
npm run test:coverage
# Open coverage/index.html in your browser
```

**Note**: Coverage reports are excluded from git via `.gitignore`

Status: ‚úÖ Production ready with comprehensive testing, coverage reporting, and memory integration

### Pixel purchase delegation usage

If you have an external producer for pixel events, you can trigger a post via:

```js
const { emitter } = require('./lib/bridge');
emitter.emit('pixel.bought', { activity: { x: 10, y: 20, sats: 42, letter: 'A', color: '#fff' } });
```

The service handles text generation and posting. See `test/service.pixelBought.test.js`.

Notes:
- Pixel events are deduplicated within the service (5‚Äëminute TTL) using `payment_hash` ‚Üí `event_id`/`id` ‚Üí `x,y,created_at` as the key.
- To disable delegation memory writes in the listener, set `LNPIXELS_CREATE_DELEGATION_MEMORY=false` (default); set to `true` to persist a small reference memory.
- Anti-spam: service posts at most one pixel note per hour by default; set `LNPIXELS_POST_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` to override.

## Topic Analysis & Narrative Summaries (overview)

The plugin extracts concise topics per post and generates sliding-window hourly summaries plus longer daily summaries, including diversity metrics (unique topics, top-3 concentration, HHI) and per-topic samples to ground the analysis.

- Sliding window adapts to new content via `LLM_HOURLY_POOL_SIZE`.
- Narrative size/cost are tuned by `LLM_NARRATIVE_SAMPLE_SIZE` and `LLM_NARRATIVE_MAX_CONTENT`.
- Per-post bounds are controlled by `CONTEXT_LLM_TOPIC_MAXLEN` and `CONTEXT_LLM_SENTIMENT_MAXLEN`.

See `TOPIC_ANALYSIS_AND_NARRATIVE.md` for full details and tuning guidance.
